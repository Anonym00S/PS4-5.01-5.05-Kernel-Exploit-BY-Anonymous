# PS4-5.01-5.05-Kernel-Exploit-BY-Anonymous
A fully implemented kernel exploit for the PS4 on 5.01-5.05 FW 
In this project you will find a full implementation of the "0dayz" kernel exploit for the PlayStation 4 on 5.01-5.05. It will allow you to run arbitrary code as kernel, to allow jailbreaking and kernel-level modifications to the system. This release however, does not contain any code related to defeating anti-piracy mechanisms or running homebrew. This exploit does include a loader that listens for payloads on port 9020 and will execute them upon receival.
You can find qwertyoruiopz original write-up on the bug here, you can find my technical write-up which dives more into implementation specifics here.
Patches Included
The following patches are made by default in the kernel ROP chain:
Disable kernel write protection
Allow RWX (read-write-execute) memory mapping
Dynamic Resolving (sys_dynlib_dlsyn2) allowed from any process
Custom system call #19 (kexec()) to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode
Allow unprivileged users to call setuid(67) successfully. Works as a status check, doubles as a privilege escalation.
Notes
This exploit is actually incredibly stable at around 95% in my tests. WebKit very rarely crashes and the same is true with kernel.
I've built in a patch so the kernel exploit will only run once on the system. You can still make additional patches via payloads.
A custom syscall is added (#19) to execute any RWX memory in kernel mode, this can be used to execute payloads that want to do fun things like jailbreaking and patching the kernel.
An SDK is not provided in this release, however a barebones one to get started with may be released at a later date.
I've released a sample payload here that will make the necessary patches to access the debug menu of the system via settings, jailbreaks, and escapes the sandbox.
